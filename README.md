# Platypus

An international travel app to make logistics easier.

## Functionality
The traveller only needs to submit the country in which they have citizenship and the country to which they want to travel and click submit. The proper travel information will populate in the drop downs below. 

Users can also convert their budget from their origin country's currency to their destination's currency.

## Technology Used
- Semantic UI
- Sherpa API
- Javascript / JQuery


## Known Issues
- Case sensitive: Countries must be _capitalized_ in order to avoid validation error.
- User feedback: Once the user submits, there is no indication the API call went through, but the data will populate.

## Future Development
- Create users that will auto-generate travel checklists upon country submission.
- A more robust currency calculator with chosen currencies.
